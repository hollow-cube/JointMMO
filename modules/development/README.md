## Development server
Intended to be run both locally and on a remote server. Provides tooling for content creation and debugging.

Since the server is meant to run locally, services should be optionally stubbed out when relevant. 
For example, a noop chat storage system is available in case you are not doing anything related and 
do not want to run a database for it to use.
