A quest is defined as follows:

"name": {
    JSON Data
}

In a file containing quests to load, each quest should be a string key that maps to a JSON object value. Multiple quests
can be stored in the same file, with unique names as their identifiers.

The JSON Data of a quest is as follows:

{
    "mode": "parallel"
    "objectives": [
        JSON Objects
    ]
}

There is an "mode" key, which can either be "sequence", or "parallel". If the mode is sequence, the objectives
must be completed in order, while in parallel all objectives can be worked on at the same time
There is an "objectives" key inside the quest object, with an array of JSON objects as its parameter.

Each Objective object is defined as follows:
{
    "type": Type of Objective
    [optional] "parameterName": argument
}
If an objective requires certain parameters, those parameters are represented by key-value pairs that map the objective name
to the argument it will be at

Example of a "Kill 10 Zombies" objective:
{
    "type": "kill_mob",
    "id": "zombie"
    "count": 10
}
