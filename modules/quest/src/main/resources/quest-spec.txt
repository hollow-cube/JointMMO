A quest is defined as follows:

"name": {
    JSON Data
}

In a file containing quests to load, each quest should be a string key that maps to a JSON object value. Multiple quests
can be stored in the same file, with unique names as their identifiers.

The JSON Data of a quest is as follows:

{
    "objectives": [
        JSON Objects
    ]
}

There is an "objectives" key inside the quest object, with an array of JSON objects as its parameter.

Each Objective object is defined as follows:
{
    "name": Name of Objective
    "parameters": [
        Optional list of requirements, if this objective has any.
    ]
}

Example of a "Kill 10 Zombies" objective:
{
    "name": "kill_mob",
    "parameters": [
        "zombie",
        10
    ]
}
